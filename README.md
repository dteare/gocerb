# Go Cerb!

Implements Webgroup Media's [Cerb Helpdesk API](https://cerb.ai/docs/api/) in Golang.

## Setup 

Ensure you [enable the API plugin](https://cerb.ai/guides/api/configure-plugin/) on your Cerb instance and generate an API key-pair. Be sure to set the endpoints that you want to allow.

## Usage

[Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) and make sure your [GOPATH](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH) is set.

`go get github.com/dteare/gocerb`

Copy `sample-creds.json` to `~/.config/cerb/creds.json` and update it with your API key-pair that you created.

Update `cerb.NewCerberus` with your base server URL in `main.go`.

## Testing

Run `go run main.go` and you should see:

```
$ go run main.go
